             &nbsp;Little Joe's is a family restaurant and pub that was founded
             by our grandparents Connie and Joe Assenato Sr. in 1946. They had a vision of establishing a care free, friendly place where you
             can enter alone and walk out with a new friend. Connie and Joe Sr. sacrificed to make great food and drinks
             affordable to the masses so all can enjoy. Their son Joe Jr., the current owner, took to the bar with his passion of making drinks
             and his mother Connie tirelessly cooked her genuine Italian recipes. They have passed away but their creation of such a
             establishment lives on 67 years later with Joe Jr. and his nephews Michael and Peter.<br /> <br />

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a successful grand opening the business began to establish itself in the Taylor street community. Little Joe's
             has survived through the years because of the dedication from the family. The establishment got up on its feet with the help of considerate
             relatives such as my Aunt Deloris  and Little Joe's brother Pete Sr. Little Joe's draws inspiration from all over the world and has always
             been welcoming to people from all different walks of life. Little Joe's most famous drink is "The Snakebite."&nbsp; The inspiration from this
             drink came to Joe when he went on a trip to Las Vegas in the 1970's. He was amazed at the rattlesnakes in the desert and decided to capture
             some of that enthusiasm inside his passion of making drinks. The Snakebite has been Little Joe's favorite drink for over 40 years. Currently
             Joe Jr., or Little Joe, is the 2nd generation owner   who continues to deliver a laid back atmosphere while maintaining an exciting venue to
             party with your closest friends and family. <br /><br />


             &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our Little Pub  has tons of history, we have been through wars, depressions, supervisions, riots,
             and even attack on our American way of life. Through all this ludicrous and havoc we are still known for being cozy and free of worries since
             my Grandfather opened the doors.  Our Family prides ourselves in customer service,  keeping uplifting environment, great food, fair prices and
             most of all authentic unique atmosphere. If you come alone you're going to meet gents of different talents and personality.   <br /><br />

             &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Assenato family 3rd Generation is proud to say we our truly family owned, family ran and intend
             on staying that way.  Since 1946 The Assenato family has been working the kitchen and the bar. That means we're the people making the food, serving
             you pizza and mixing cocktails same as the 1st generation did 67 years ago.  We not only own our establishment we work it too. This is what
             Little Joe's is about and always will be. Little Joe's is truly unique and no one shall ever take that away from this landmark. Were proud of our
             work and grateful to our loyal customers over the years.  You just can't beat that!<br />
